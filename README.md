# Squad_A_Will_Leonard_FinalProject

This is the final project for the WPP python programming course. It uses a Flask to run a site natively on your computer.

## Instillation

Use the package manager pip to install flask.
```bash
pip install Flask
```

Also, install Jinja using the package manager pip.
```bash
pip install jinja2
```

## Usage

You can use this app to find data about each NHL team from the league's API. The home endpoint provides instructions, but you can go directly to team stats using the teamID/# (where numbers 0-31 represent team IDs) or player data using the playerID/# (player IDs are 7 digit numbers) endpoints.
